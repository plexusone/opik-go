## Introduction & Overview

What is Opik and how we approached the SDK

---

<!--
What is Opik? <break time="500ms"/>
Opik is an open-source LLM observability platform created by Comet ML. <break time="600ms"/>
It provides several key capabilities. <break time="400ms"/>
Traces and Spans for tracking LLM calls and application flow. <break time="500ms"/>
Datasets for storing test data for evaluation. <break time="400ms"/>
Experiments for running and comparing model evaluations. <break time="500ms"/>
Prompts for versioning and managing prompt templates. <break time="400ms"/>
And Feedback for capturing quality scores and user feedback. <break time="600ms"/>
Our goal was to build a comprehensive Go SDK <break time="300ms"/>
that matches the Python SDK's capabilities. <break time="800ms"/>
-->

<!--
Let me walk you through the key design decisions we made. <break time="600ms"/>
First, we chose ogen for API client generation. <break time="500ms"/>
ogen provides type-safe code with no reflection, <break time="400ms"/>
and correctly handles optional and nullable fields. <break time="500ms"/>
We generated the client from an OpenAPI spec with over 14,000 lines. <break time="600ms"/>
Second, we used the Functional Options pattern for configuration. <break time="500ms"/>
This is idiomatic Go and allows for clean, readable client initialization. <break time="600ms"/>
Third, we implemented context-based tracing, <break time="400ms"/>
using Go's standard context.Context for automatic parent-child span relationships. <break time="800ms"/>
-->

# Key Design Decisions 🎯

### 1. **ogen for API Client Generation**
- Type-safe, no reflection
- Handles optional/nullable fields correctly
- Generated from OpenAPI spec (14,846 lines)

### 2. **Functional Options Pattern**
```go
client, err := opik.NewClient(
    opik.WithAPIKey("key"),
    opik.WithWorkspace("workspace"),
    opik.WithProjectName("my-project"),
)
```

### 3. **Context-Based Tracing**
- Idiomatic Go using `context.Context`
- Automatic parent-child span relationships

The evaluation framework includes over 10 heuristic metrics, <break time="400ms"/>
8 or more LLM judge metrics, a G-EVAL implementation, <break time="400ms"/>
custom judge support, and a concurrent evaluation engine. <break time="600ms"/>
For integrations, we built OpenAI and Anthropic tracing transports, <break time="400ms"/>
a GoLLM adapter for ADK, and HTTP middleware. <break time="800ms"/>

<!--
Our testing strategy mirrored the Python SDK's patterns. <break time="500ms"/>
We built a test utilities package with a Matcher interface, <break time="400ms"/>
providing flexible matchers like Any, AnyButNil, AnyString, AnyMap, and AnyFloat. <break time="600ms"/>
We also built a MockServer, similar to Python's respx library. <break time="600ms"/>
Looking at test coverage, the Core SDK has 15 test files covering client, trace, span, config, and context. <break time="600ms"/>
The Evaluation package has 6 test files for all metrics, scoring, and the engine. <break time="500ms"/>
Integrations have 6 test files for providers and tracing transports. <break time="500ms"/>
And Test Utils has 2 test files for matchers and the mock server. <break time="800ms"/>
-->

# Testing Strategy 🧪

### Mirrored Python SDK's Testing Patterns

**Test Utilities** (`testutil/`)
- `Matcher` interface: `Any()`, `AnyButNil()`, `AnyString()`, `AnyMap()`, `AnyFloat()`
- `MockServer` - HTTP mock server similar to Python's `respx`

**Test Coverage**
| Package | Test Files | Key Tests |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Core SDK | 15 files | Client, trace, span, config, context |
| Evaluation | 6 files | All metrics, scoring, engine |
| Integrations | 6 files | Providers, tracing transports |
| Test Utils | 2 files | Matchers, mock server |

---

<!--
Here's an example of how the mock server works. <break time="500ms"/>
You create a new MockServer and defer its close. <break time="500ms"/>
Then you set up a route using OnPost with a path, <break time="400ms"/>
and define the JSON response with RespondJSON. <break time="600ms"/>
You can then create your provider pointing to the mock server URL, <break time="400ms"/>
make the request, and verify the response. <break time="500ms"/>
Finally, you can assert that the correct number of requests were made. <break time="500ms"/>
This pattern makes testing HTTP integrations clean and reliable. <break time="800ms"/>
-->

# Test Example: Mock Server 💻

```go
func TestProviderComplete(t *testing.T) {
    ms := testutil.NewMockServer()
    defer ms.Close()

    ms.OnPost("/v1/chat/completions").RespondJSON(200, map[string]any{
        "choices": []map[string]any{{
            "message": map[string]any{"content": "Hello!"},
        }},
    })

    provider := openai.NewProvider(openai.WithBaseURL(ms.URL()))
    resp, err := provider.Complete(ctx, request)

    // Verify response
    assert.Equal(t, "Hello!", resp.Content)

    // Verify request was made correctly
    assert.Equal(t, 1, ms.RequestCount())
}
```

The config format changed significantly, <break time="400ms"/>
requiring iterative fixes with immediate validation. <break time="600ms"/>
Challenge 3: Matching Python SDK patterns. <break time="400ms"/>
Different language idioms meant adapting patterns, <break time="400ms"/>
like using context instead of decorators. <break time="600ms"/>
Challenge 4: Test utilities. <break time="400ms"/>
We needed something like Python's respx for mocking, <break time="400ms"/>
so we built a custom MockServer with route matching. <break time="800ms"/>

# Challenges & Solutions 🔧

1. ### Challenge 1: ogen Generated Code
    - **Issue**: Complex optional types in API responses
    - **Solution**: Careful handling of `OptXxx` types with `.Set` checks
2. ### Challenge 2: golangci-lint v2 Config
    - **Issue**: Config format changed significantly
    - **Solution**: Iterative fixes with immediate validation
3. ### Challenge 3: Matching Python SDK Patterns
    - **Issue**: Different language idioms
    - **Solution**: Adapted patterns (e.g., context vs decorators)
4. ### Challenge 4: Test Utilities
    - **Issue**: Need Python's `respx`-like mocking
    - **Solution**: Built custom `MockServer` with route matching
